# Understanding Prototype Methods

Understanding how to use prototype methods is an important step in learning how to work with application data. As you build more complex applications, you'll find yourself working with very large datasets. These datasets might need to be massaged into new formats or connect to other sources of data. Prototype methods will give you the tools to accomplish these tasks.

In order to be successful when working with prototype methods, you'll need to have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

* dot vs. bracket notation - when, why, and how to use each
* mutator vs. accessor vs. iterator methods
* the main characteristics of each prototype method:
  * what it does
  * what arguments it takes in
  * what it returns
