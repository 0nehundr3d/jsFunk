Level 1

Code: 
  Write a function called "findClubMembers" that takes in the clubs data as an argument.  Your function should create an object whose keys are the names of people, and whose values are arrays that include the names of the clubs that person is a part of. 

Invoke: 
   with in a console.log().
e.g.
  console.log(findClubMembers(clubs))
    should print --> 
    {
      Louisa: ['Drama', 'Art'],
      Pam: ['Drama', 'Art', 'Chess'],
      Nathaniel: ['Drama', 'Astronomy'],
      ...etc
    }

Annotate:
  After you find a solution, write out the steps of that solution.  Break them down as much as possible.

/*
Level 2

Test:
  *Uncomment the module.exports below.
  *Unskip the 1 Club Prompts tests in your prototype-test.js file.
  *Run `npm test` to confirm that your function is passing its test.
  *Refactor as need until the test is passing

Annotation:
  If your test did not immediately pass, make note of what details you missed while building and checking your solutions. 
  Make note of the error messages that led you to fixing those details.
