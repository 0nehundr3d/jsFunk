# Understanding Context with the keyword `this`

Understanding how the value of `this` changes throughout your code is an important part of recognizing where you are within your execution, and what object is currently being acted upon. You can think of `this` as the current owner, or subject, of whatever code is executing at the time. It is a concept often mixed up with scope, and though they are related, they actually describe somewhat different things.

There are several rules you must keep in mind in order to successfully keep track of your context:

* what object global functions are declared on
* how the invocation of a method changes the value of `this`
* when `this` is set for traditional functions vs. arrow functions
